# Yen's K-Shortest Path Algorithm in C
Yen's K-Shortest Path algothim gives the list of K shortest paths from a source to a sink given K.
There is no available C code for this algorithm. So this is a C implementation.

#### Why C and not C++?
This is a specific requirement for working at physical layer.

### Warning!
This code has not been tested. Also exceptions and corner cases have not been handled.
